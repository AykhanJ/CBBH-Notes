# What is HTML Injection?

HTML Injection happens when a website shows user input without checking or cleaning it.

ðŸ”„ Where It Happens
From backend (e.g., showing user comments saved in the database)
From frontend (e.g., input displayed immediately using JavaScript)

`<style> body { background-image: url('https://academy.hackthebox.com/images/logo.svg'); } </style>` - The page background changes, meaning HTML Injection
