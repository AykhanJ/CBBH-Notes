Curl Command:

| Commands      | Purpose       |
|---------------|---------------|
| `curl inlanefreight.com` | prints the site in its raw format | 
| `curl -O inlanefreight.com/index.html` | downloading a file| 
| `curl -s -O http://example.com` | silent mode, doesn't show when a file is downloading| 


if we contact a website with an invalid SSL certificate, then cURL by default would not proceed with the communication. To bypass this: 
`curl -k https://inlanefreight.com`

| `curl inlanefreight.com -v` | verbose mode|
